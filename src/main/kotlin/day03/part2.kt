/*
* Both the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating are values that can
* be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky part.
* Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out
* values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start
* with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and consider
* just the first bit of those numbers. Then:
*    - Keep only numbers selected by the bit criteria for the type of rating value
*      for which you are searching. Discard numbers which do not match the bit
*      criteria.
*    - If you only have one number left, stop; this is the rating value for which
*      you are searching.
*    - Otherwise, repeat the process, considering the next bit to the right.
*
* The bit criteria depends on which type of rating value you want to find:
*    - To find oxygen generator rating, determine the most common value (0 or 1) in
*      the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position.
*      If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the position being
*      considered.
*    - To find CO2 scrubber rating, determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the
*      current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position.
*      If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being
*      considered.
*
* Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the oxygen generator
* rating and CO2 scrubber rating, then multiply them together. What is the life
* support rating of the submarine?
