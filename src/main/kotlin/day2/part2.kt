* - down X increases your aim by X units.

* - forward X does two things:
*     1) It increases your horizontal position by X units.
*     2) It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.
* Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after
* following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply
* your final horizontal position by your final depth?
